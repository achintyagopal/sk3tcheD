sk3tcheD 

How to Run (or Build): 
To use sk3tcheD, you can download the repo and run the built file, sk3tcheD. 

How to Use: To use sk3tcheD, you need to have a LeapMotion. You will need to use one hand over the LeapMotion and the other on the keyboard. Different keyboard commands control what you see and draw. 

The following commands are for drawing: 
1 - Pencil drawing 
2 - Draw Line 
3 - Draw cube 
4 - Draw sphere 
5 - Draw cone 
To draw, you move your hand to where to you want to start drawing, and hold the corresponding button until you are done with the shape. 

The following commands are for moving the screen: 
Q - move backwards 
E - move forwards 
W - move up 
S - move down 
A - move left 
D - move right 

The following commands are miscellaneous: 
Z - undo pencil drawing 
Shift-2 - saves a screenshot of what's on the screen (including the menu button, the menu if open, and your hand if over the LeapMotion) 
Shift-3 - saves a .obj file of your drawing (not including the menu button, the menu, or your hands), which can then be converted into a .stl file with Blender or any other 3d image convertor and can then be printed using a 3D printer. 
(The first screen of the program shows all the above commands) 

Hand Gestures: 
Horizontal Swipe - to continue to program from first screen 
Pinch (thumb to one finger) - grab object (not pencil markings) and move around, moves where your thumb is 
Squeeze (thumb to more than two fingers) - deletes object (not pencil markings)
